title: Does the Type of School You Attend Have Higher Odds of a School Shooting Happening?
subtitle: School Shootings Data from 1990-Present
---

We hear about school shootings too often. It is overwhelming enough to hear about shootings anywhere in the world,
but even more so shootings happening in schools where there are _kids_ and people who are truly just making an
effort to get an education and make the best out of their lives.

In my effort to understand what is happening at these schools, I came up with a question: Does the type of school
you attend have higher odds of a school shooting happening? I found some data that goes back to 1990 and ran a few tests.

Turns out there is significantly more shootings happening at **High Schools**

I was not entirely surprised of my findings since, unfortunately, some of the biggest news coverage on school shootings has been about High School shootings.

As I looked further into the data, I came up with another question: Are school shootings happening more frequently on
specific months?

After running some tests, I have found that there is some correlation when the shootings happen and the time of year.
It seems it is **more likely** for shootings to occur closer to **February** and also in **October**.

Now that leaves me wondering why. Time to research more data and see if we can get to the bottom of this.
